# Hang In There

### Summary
We created a website that user's can interact with to build a motivational poster.  Each poster will follow the format of image, title and inspirational quote. 

### How it Works
- User's can generate random posters with the "Show Another Random Poster" button.  
- If user clicks "Make Your Own Poster" button, they have the capability of customizing their own poster.  
- Once the form is filled out, the user can click the "Show My Poster" button to view their creation.
- For either randomized poster or user generated poster, clicking the "Save this Poster" button will store this poster for future use.  
- Then, to view the saved posters, click the "Saved Posters" button. 

### Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

### Future Additions
- Create functionality for filtering saved posters.
- Add a "favorites" button.
- Build code to view saved posters individually.
